# RDF-Highlighter

This project was created to facilitate generating RDF annotations based off of a user's inputted PDF form. The user can highlight certain texts in the PDF and denote whether the given text is a property or a resource. Based on these annotations, the user can then export a ttl file denoting the RDF resources and properties.  

## Running RDF-Highlighter in development mode:
1. Clone the repository `git clone https://github.com/aSehat/MITR-Project.git`
2. cd into the root directory of this project
3. Run `npm install`
